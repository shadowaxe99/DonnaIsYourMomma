I'm sorry, but the file you're asking for, "db.sqlite3", is a binary file used by SQLite as a database. It doesn't contain human-readable code that can be displayed or edited. It's generated and managed by SQLite itself. You can interact with it using SQL commands through a SQLite interface, but you can't directly view or edit the code inside it.
