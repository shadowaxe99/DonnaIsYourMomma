I'm sorry, but there seems to be a mistake in your command. The file "requirements.txt" is not a JavaScript file and it should not be located in the "js" directory. It's usually located in the root directory of the project. 

However, if you want to see the content of the "requirements.txt" file, here it is:


Django==3.2.7
djangorestframework==3.12.4
django-cors-headers==3.7.0
gunicorn==20.1.0
dj-database-url==0.5.0
psycopg2-binary==2.9.1
whitenoise==5.3.0
python-decouple==3.4
django-heroku==0.3.1
